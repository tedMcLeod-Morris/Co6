	"Hap?" 
	"Hap? Wake up." 
	Hap cracked his eyes. The felt scratchy, and hid body ached.
	DeMing stood beside his bed, his face showed contempt. "You don't look good." 
	Hap blinked his eyes, trying to understand why DeMing was standing there. Behind him, his four familiars stood, tall and pretty. Each one a cool, disdainful beauty.
	"Look at me." DeMing said. "Hey, how are you feeling?"
	Hap tried to reply, his voice a croak.
	"Yes, you don't look even that good." DeMing raised a hand, summoning the nurse. "Church yard. May be our only hope."
	She nodded, her mouth set in a grim line. "Right away, Lord."
	DeMing spun away, walking quickly. He wrinkled his nose, offended by the smell of the healer's tent. His four familiars glided after him, hips waving in a sensous parade.
	"We're going to put you in the church yard, dear." Said the nurse. "That will draw out the infection. I'm afraid the leshky had dirty claws and all of your wounds have infected."
	"What?" Hap croaked. "What are my chances." 
	"This is the best way." She said. She avoided answering, which meant she didn't want to lie. 
	Hap sank back, tired and aching.
