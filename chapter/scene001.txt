	Ellorell deMing, Ambassador from Faerie to the Court of King Brian XII, stroked his chin. Below his seat, the men of Company 6 sweated on the sands of the arena. Captain Vashan's voice drifted up in a quiet bark, like a distant dog yapping. The men of the Company worked their shields and swords in the familiar drill of infantry. 
	Front and center was a heavy set man. His armor looked tight and his cap rested on top of his head, rather than surrounding it, as it should. With each order, the men went through their paces, but this man executed each move with energy, snapping his short sword out, lifting his shield and lunging forward as if he were facing a real enemy. While other men waved their swords gently, avoiding effort, his sword snapped out and back with a cutting stroke that showed real intensity.
	"I have decided to visit the end of the world." Ellorell said. 
	"Yes, ambassador." His aide replied. "What may we provide you?"
	Ellorell tilted his head to one side, his blond hair floated over his shoulder as if moved by some personal breeze. "I require an escort. Have that man included." He said, pointing to the heavy man in the center of the formation.
	"Sir?" The aide paused, staring. "You wish someone from Company 6 to come with you?"
	Ellorell glanced at the aide. His slim face cocked quizzically. "No, I want that man, I find him amusing. The rest of the cadre at your best judgement."
