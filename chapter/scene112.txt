	I was loaded onto a stretcher from my bed and then moved onto a wagon. The ride was bumpy and took a while. I dozed, exhausted. I woke up to being unloaded from the wagon and carried through a church yard, around to the back. I was stripped naked including my bandages. My wounds stook out from my arm, red angry cuts that weeped blood and pus. They eased me into a shallow trench in the ground. My head was propped up and soil was shoveled over me. I felt cool, soil   soaking away some fever heat. 
	Sadly, I contemplated my grave. Buried six inches deep, with only my head above ground, I was as good a dead. The crunch of footsteps approached and I opened my eyes.
	An older man approached, he held some sort of watering can with a slim spout. 
	"Welcome to our church yard." He said. 
	I stared up at him, feeling the grotesque humor at his cheerful manner.
	"I know this is difficult." He said. "But we have a strong yard here, and many have emerged from the ground fit and healthy. You are in the best care possible for your injuries. Would you like a drink?" He offered the spout to me.
	I opened my mouth and he dribbled water in. Clean and cool, I sucked down as much as he would give.
	"Now, a few things. First, pee and poop as you feel fit. The soil cleans away such thing." He smiled, nodding. "Your wounds will be cleaned in the same way. I will be pulling back the dirt in a day or so to see how your are responding."
