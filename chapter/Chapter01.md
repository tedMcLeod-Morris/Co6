##Chron and the world


	Ellorell deMing, Ambassador from Faerie to the Court of King Brian XII, stroked his chin. Below his seat, the men of Company 6 sweated on the sands of the arena. Captain Vashan's voice drifted up in a quiet bark, like a distant dog yapping. The men of the Company worked their shields and swords in the familiar drill of infantry. 
	Front and center was a heavy set man. His armor looked tight and his cap rested on top of his head, rather than surrounding it, as it should. With each order, the men went through their paces, but this man executed each move with energy, snapping his short sword out, lifting his shield and lunging forward as if he were facing a real enemy. While other men waved their swords gently, avoiding effort, his sword snapped out and back with a cutting stroke that showed real intensity.
	"I have decided to visit the end of the world." Ellorell said. 
	"Yes, ambassador." His aide replied. "What may we provide you?"
	Ellorell tilted his head to one side, his blond hair floated over his shoulder as if moved by some personal breeze. "I require an escort. Have that man included." He said, pointing to the heavy man in the center of the formation.
	"Sir?" The aide paused, staring. "You wish someone from Company 6 to come with you?"
	Ellorell glanced at the aide. His slim face cocked quizzically. "No, I want that man, I find him amusing. The rest of the cadre at your best judgement."

	Captain Vashan yelled. "Officer in the room!" 
	Hap straightened up from cleaning the toilet, coming to attention. He resisted the urge to salute with his toilet brush, knowing that little gestures of defiance would only make his life harder. 
	"Private Fat!" Vashan yelled. "You have been detailed to accompany a very important person. You will not disgrace Company 6. Do you hear me?"
	"Yes sir!" Hap yelled. The white tile echoed with his response. He stood at attention until Vashan had left the room and then relaxed. What now? He asked himself?

###

	I stood at attention in the court yard. My helmet sat low over my eyes, blocking any view of the sky. My armor rubbed on my neck and my kerchief had already slipped down, uselessly low. I would have to dig that out to put it between the edge of my armor and my neck. My pack rode on my hips, the weight balanced and comfortable. I dug my thumb under each strap, checking for tightness. My shield rested on the ground, leaning against my leg. It could be slung over my pack, or carried in front where it would bang against my leg with each step. 
	Around my, the men of Company 4 stood, at rest. Each man wore mail and an open face helmet. The carried rapier and dagger on their hip and a cape slung over their left side. They talked quietly, chuckling at some joke. 
	I caught them glancing at me, seeing a single thick man sweating under the morning sun. Even with the cool air of the night still lingering, the low sunlight warmed me to the point of sweating. Once we set out, I would be soaked and panting quickly. 
	I stood alone in the courtyard, waiting for the Fae Ambassador. Company 4 often guarded important visitors. They specialized in looking sharp, making a favorable impression on ambassadors and foreign princes. I stood out like a hog in a hen house, a thick awkward body among thin muscular men. I carried a heavy shield that would be part of a shield wall. They used rapiers that could deal elegant death. 
	Once again, Piggly Wiggly had arranged to embarass me.
	The rumble of a carriage warned that the Ambassador was coming. The men straightened, coming to attention. Each man stepped into position, standing in neatly arranged ranks, head held high, backs straight. 
	I lifted my shield, bringing the edge up nose height, leaving the armor on my shins to protect my legs and feet. 
	A barked command brought all the rapiers into the air in a silent salute. I was the only man standing inert. I grabbed my short sword to lift it in an imitation of their salute, its stubby wide blade looking more like a toy than a lethal weapon. 
	The carriage gleamed in the morning light. Purched on the rear, the driver controlled the magic that drove it. In the cabin, Ambassador Ellorell DeMing surveyed the gathered troops with a disdainfull look. Around him, the ladies in waiting looked at us with equal coolness. 
	DeMing was a slim man, almost skeletally thin with a long face, long thin nose  and eyes so turned up at the corner that he was a cartoon of oriental eyes. His ears were large and pointed. He wore a slim coronet of gold with a single purple gem in the middle of his forehead. His hair was a golden fluff rising from the top of his head in a crest that would have been found on some exotic bird. His clothes shimmered with a silken finish of grays and purples. 
	I looked straight ahead, resisting the urge to stare. Among the soldiers in this courtyard, I was the only one from Company 6, the only one who could show that Company 6 was more than a collection of losers and freaks. 
	I wondered why I was here. Piggly Wiggly had braced me yesterday and yelled orders to draw traveling gear and report to the courtyard to accompany the Fae ambassador. I hadn't seen anyone else from Company 6 show up. Still, I had to do my best. 
	A sargent from Company 4 marched over and turned to face me. "You will ride post on the Ambassador's carriage!" He yelled, each word spoken slowly, clearly, as if he were talking to a foreigner or idiot. "Do you understand?" 
	Resentment burst through me which I choked back. This was simply some hazing, some attempt to put the weakling from 6 in his place.
	"Yes! Sargent!" I yelled back. I turned sharply to face the carriage and double timed over. 
	Soldiers stood at the front of the carriage, but an empty running board remained at the back. I grabbed a handle and hauled myself up to stand at attention, looking forward like the rest of the solders. 
	"So much parade, and no progress." Said the driver. He stood on a running board wide enough for two with a padded bar behind him where he could rest. He had a stick in front of him. 
	"Hurry up and wait." I said. I didn't look at him, and kept my voice quiet. With a strangled laugh, he whispered, "Don't get me started so early."
	Finally, after all of the men had been loaded onto two big flat carriages, the gates swung open and we began to ease forward. The gates were wide enough for the carriages, but only by a couple of feet. When we emerged onto city streets, we manuevered carefull, avoiding pedestrians, wagons. 
	Only after we had cleared the city gates did we begin to accelerate. Standing on the outside, with the big cart wheels next to me, felt like a motorcycle ride. A big silent motorcycle, admittedly, but we were soon racing along at 60 mph. The wind didn't hit me in the face, so something was protecting me. I just hung on, enjoying the scenery.
	"You can park your shield here." Said the driver, indicating a cupboard. I nodded and slid the big thing in.  
	"How about my pack?" I asked.
	"Should be room." He said. "I'm Pete Uglyson." He held out his hand. 
	I shook it, making him wince. Then I realized he was waiting for my pack. I slipped out of it, and handed it to him. He grunted with effort and swung it down into the cupboard.
	"I'm Hap Addersley." I said. "Pleased to meet you." 
	He glanced around at the other soldiers riding on the carriage "Why are you with these dummies?"
	I looked around. Standing at the back of the carriage, with the wind whipping by, we were pretty isolated. "Don't really know. I was ordered to accompany the Ambassador, given traveling kit and sent to stand in the courtyard."
	Checking the carriage, Pete turned back to me. He was a heavy set man, bald on top with a fringe of hair tied back in a flowing pony tail. Salt and pepper hair showed gray mixed in with black. He wore a thick woolen scarf stuffed into the collar of a canvas coat that buttoned up his left side.
	"I drive this thing all over and they often come with." Pete said, nodding towards the men at the front. "Bunch of shiny arm chair generals, all of them. Couldn't fight an angry girl, if you ask me." 
	I grinned. "You've seen them in action?"
	"Nope," Pete said. "They stand around, looking pretty and polishing each other's swords. But you look different."
	"Well, first of all, I'm not part of Company 4." I said. I started to feel embarassed about coming from Company 6. While I knew it was a retirement post, I didn't know how other people looked at it."
	"What Company are you from?" Pete asked. 
	I felt my cheeks warm at his question. Many of the men in my company were wounded while in service. They didn't have any other way to survive except by living with the Company. For better or worse, I was part of them. I was living in a retirement home. Pete looked at me, waiting for my answer. Feeling the moment stretch, I said. "Company 6."
	Pete cocked his head. "Company 6? You know Captain Holmivenson?"
	Puzzled by this, I looked down, trying to remember any captains in the company other than Piggly Wiggly. That name tickled my memory and I couldn't bring up anyone.
	"Yeah Holmivenson. Big blond guy, fights like a natural disaster. You know him?"
	"I know Eric." I said. "Big blond guy. Married to a cook, Esme. Could that be him?" 
	"Yeah, that's him." Pete said. "Say hello next time you see him. Remind him of Pete and tell him I still remember."
	"Sure. No problem." I said. "Mind if I ask what you remember?"
	Pete closed his eyes for a long moment, and then heaved a sigh. "Let's just say I owe the Captain. Owe him big time."
	I nodded. "OK. I'll tell him." I said. "But you could come around most mornings and say it yourself."
	Pete shook his head. "He's had his brains half bashed out of his head. And I don't want to embarass him, or anything. I saw a camp full of two legged animals get what they deserved. I saw him up close and personal. And I'll always, to the day I die, be grateful."   

	Hap walked his route, shield close to his body, his sword sheathed on his left hip. Black sky above filled with stars gave no light for him. His eyes had adapted to the dark, giving him some sense of the trees as dark shapes. He hit the end of his route and stamped his feet. One, two, he stamped and then turned and walked back. 
	Campfire had died to coals, leaving only the barest shapes of tents. Some of the guard slept on a pile of thick quilts. 
	"Dark out here." 
	Hap snapped around, his hand on the hilt of his sword. Ambassador DeMing glowed with a soft light that stood out from the darkness of the forest.
	"I find the dark, unsettling." DeMing said. "Don't you?"
	Hap froze. He was on guard duty and supposed to walk his route. But the Ambassador was a very important person and in charge of this expedition. He looked around and didn't see any other guards. He would have to humor the Ambassador.
	"I'm not used to this kind of darkness." Hap said. 
	"Yes. I've heard that your home glows all night with lights that can be seen for miles." 
	Hap thought, he knows about me. He knows that I came from a lost world. I have to be careful here. Hap said, "That's what I've seen."
	"Is it true that you can see your cities from a 100 miles up?" DeMing asked.
	"I've seen photos taken from space that show a river of light on the edge of the sea." Hap said. "If the clouds are low enough, you can see the glow of cities reflected on them for miles and miles."
	"Is it cloudy all the time?" 
	"No, not at all." Hap said. "Some places are as wild as this place, empty of civilization. I've seen nights this clear with the sky filled with stars."
	"Really?" DeMing said. "But your world is lost to demons. Didn't you understand that?"
	Hap froze. He had been warned against talking about demons. Could this be a trap? 
	"You don't want to say anything about that?" DeMing said. "Perhaps you feel ashamed of what happened to your world?"
	'No, not that." Hap said. "I was cautioned against saying anything about my home, especially about demons."
	"Yes, yes, yes." DeMing said. "I was the one that insisted on that. We are fighting for our very existence against them. I insisted that you be sealed and cautioned to keep quiet."
	"Sealed?" Hap asked. "You know about that?"
	"Oh, yes. I insisted that we needed to be safe. So it was agreed to seal you to keep you from using your abilities if you were possessed by a demon."
	Hap felt his face flush with anger. "You put this on me?"
	"Well, it was either that, or have you killed." DeMing said. 
	"I went through the purification." Hap said. "I was cleared of any contamination." 
	DeMing flapped his hand, dismissively. "Yes but better safe than sorry, don't you know." He turned to look west, into the dark forest.
	Hap wanted to tear DeMing apart. He wanted to lecture him and call him names that would make him cry. He took a deep breath, struggling to gain control. "So could you..." Hap said, struggling to speak quietly. "Could you unseal me?"
	DeMing stared west, ignoring Hap. "I'm worried about the aurorial lights." 
	Hap closed his eyes, breathing deeply, struggling to maintain his calm. "Can you have me unsealed? It would mean a great lot to me. I could heal people. That would be good for everyone."
	"Hmm?" DeMing said. He hummed with a thoughtless response. Obviously ignoring Hap. "I came to see the aurorial lights."
	Gripping the hilt of his sword, Hap ground his teet together. This man, this thing was the source of his misery. "DeMing, can you unseal me?" Demanded Hap.
	"Have you seen aurora borealis?" DeMing said. 
	Hap thought that killing DeMing might ruin his chance at being unsealed. He opened his hand, letting the hilt of his sword go. "I don't see any damn lights." 
	"Exactly." DeMing said. "This is important. Are you sure you know what to look for?"
	"Yes." Hap said. "I've seen northern lights. You can't see them this far south."

	"Once a mind is broken open, the invasion is possible." DeMing said. "Demons search for open minds, for broken minds that have been exposed and plant a copy of themselves."
	"Broken minds?" I said. "How many people are broken?"
	"Minds break in a variety of ways." DeMing said, turning to looke out over the forest. "These lands have been lit by night lights for centuries."
	I bit back a sharp question and turned to look up. Stars flickered in the perfect black sky. The flowing green lights of norther lights weren't there. I have seen the aurora borealis in perfect winter nights. This was not that. 
	"Where are the lights?" I asked.
	"Precisely." DeMing said. "Where are they? I have made this journey often. I have stood here for hours watching the flow and ebb of lights over the dead lands."
	"So, we were supposed to see lights?" I asked. "Because, this is not it."
	"The lights bring death." DeMing said. "The dead lands are dead because of the lights. Even the borders of the dead lands are filled with burned victims. Now that has changed. I imagine the dead lands have lain fallow for a millenia. Now the fields can once again sprout life."
	"You mean that magnetic north has moved?"
	DeMing blinked at me, pausing to stare. He nodded once and drew a deep breath. "Yes, a magnetic pole has moved. You understand the impact of magnetic poles and solar radiation?"
	"Yea. We have speculated on what would happen if the magnetic pole moved. Mostly, we expect catastrophe."
	"Why?" DeMing asked. His tone was demanding like a teacher. 
	"Solar radiation gets deflected by planetary magnetism and redirected to the north pole." I answered. "Moving that point to somewhere else would guide all that radiation to kill plants in that area."
	DeMing nodded once. "Basically right. Except here we have multiple poles. Rather than one great shield, we have multiple shields and they are not stable. Over centuries the poles jump to new locations and change the location of dead lands. We know the old dead lands will sprout new life. We don't know where the new dead lands will appear. That is a chaotic event."
	"So, you think that the dead lands are now alive?" 
	"A new frontier, waiting for life to fill empty ecological niches." DeMing said. "Of course, the creatures that did survive in the dead lands fill many ecological roles. Especially the top level predators. Evolving in a desert of life, they hunt and breed freely. They will be spilling out of the dead lands, forced out by population pressures and hunting freely in newly fertile fields."

	"How would you know if you were demon possessed?" DeMing said. 
	Hap gritted his teeth, frustrated. "I don't know. Sudden craving for blood? Willing to torture innocents for no reason?"
	"But would you notice that you were doing it?" DeMing said. "Would you realize that say, enslaving a town of people was evil, or just doing your job?"
	"I think so." Hap said.
	"I don't." DeMing said. "I don't believe you would if you were deluded. If a demon was riding in your brain and shaping your thoughts and feelings."
	"So, if you suddenly and randomly decided to seal a man, for no reason then you might be demon possessed?" Hap said.
	"Hmm." DeMing paused. "I see what you did there. But I know that I'm not deluded. I have an imp, a second opinion that rides around in my mind all the time. I ask him if I am possessed and he tells me the truth, that I am not."
	"Can you have more than one mind in your brain?" Hap said. "Is that possible? Or are you deluded?"
	"For my people, having one extra mind is possible and even necessary. We get to see our decisions from a second view." DeMing said. "Not only do we have an objective way of looking at our actions, but we have a way to expand our abilities."
	"What?" 
	"Among other things, we have a constant watcher looking for signs of demonic influence." DeMing said. He looked at Hap. "I can't be taken over by a demon."
	"Great. Give me one." Hap said.
	DeMing looked at Hap, thoughtfully. He seemed to be considering it carefully. "I don't think that would be a good idea." 
	"Why not?" Hap said. "Then you would know that I am demon free and everyone would be happy. Right?"
	 "If you have any demonic influence, the imp would begin destroying your brain in order to eliminate the demonic contamination." DeMing said. "That would be bad for you. Besides the imp is crafted especially for our brains. Even if you are completely free of possession, the imp could damage yours."

	"So, you're just superior to us?" Hap asked. "You're better than humans?" His voice edged louder as his outrage grew. "You mean that we're like animals next to you? We're some sort of pet that can't get house trained and is likely to lift a leg on great aunt Mable?" Hap shouted.
	DeMing turned away to scan the forest. He turned back and whispered, "Lower you voice!"
	"Yeah! Sure! Whatever you say!" Hap shouted. "Nothing worse than a dog barking all the time!"
	"No, I mean that you should shut up and listen." DeMing said.
	"I'm sick of you and your arrogant, high handed..." Hap slammed to the ground. 
	The edge of his shield caught him right on the nose and the thing on his back smashed his helmet forward, partly covering his eyes. Steel screeched under claws as they raked down his back, seeking to get into his guts. 
	Hap lifted from the ground, hanging by the neck. He whipped back and forth, shaken like a rat by a terrier. He dropped to the ground, catching his shield on his helmet, saving his face. 
	Rolling over, he covered himself with his shield. The dark creature pulled back, weaving side to side, looking for an opening. Hap reached across his body to get his sword out. The movement drew an attack that seemed so fast that the creature was biting at his shield instantly, trapping his arm across his torso. 
	He could only duck his helmet forward, hiding his face behind his shield in an attempt to protect it. The edge of his shield flipped up, pulled off of him by the creature. Hap's arm went numb and he looked into the black eye and oozing nose of the creature as it bit into him, shaking its head so hard that Hap was flung over the dirt.
	"He's got my sword arm." Hap thought. "Why am I so calm? I'm being eaten alive." 
	Growling like a huge cat, the creature pulled back, dragging Hap onto his face by his arm. 
	"He's going for my neck." Hap thought. "He's going for the kill." Hap arched his neck, trying to cover his neck with the rim of his helmet. He was looking up at the creature, when DeMing appeared right behind it, plunging a slim sword into the creature and flickering out of sight as the creature spun around to confront him.
	"Maybe DeMing can help." Hap thought. "Maybe he can drive off the creature."
	The creature sprung into the air and landed with his tail to Hap. DeMing stepped forward and plunged his sword into the creature and then stepped away out of sight. 
	"He must be invisible." Hap thought. "My arm is really bleeding. I had better get it pressed against my belly." He rolled over and cradled his arm against his armor, pulling his shield close to cover himself. 
	Shouts came from the camp as the soldiers there woke and came running to see what was happening. Hap lay on the ground, holding his arm. He could hear the sounds of the animal, screeching. A furious howl rang out and the creature leapt away.
	"Hey, help! Over here!" Hap called. He took a deeper breath, feeling the sharp pain in his chest. He coughed. "I'm over here! Help!" He sounded really weak to himself. 
	His vision began to narrow, showing him some of the stars direcly over head. Hearing voices approach, he hoped they were coming, that help was coming. Above him, the sky shrank, growing red around the edges. "Am I dying?" Hap thought. "I'm tired. I'll just close my eyes for a moment. If I go to sleep then I won't wake up. But I just need to close my eyes.

	Hap heard the rustle of stiff cloth. He smelled alcohol, herbs. He tried to turn his head, to see where he was. The wool of a blanket scratched his chin. His tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. Cracking open his eyes, he winced at the burning in his eyes. He finally peeked out, looking around. He was in a tent. A man bent over him, examining his his arm, pulling gently on bandages wrapped around his arm. He took a breath and groaned with pain. 
	"Awake soldier?" The man asked, reaching to rest a cool hand on his forehead. Hap closed his eyes in simple pleasure at the coolness on his dry palm. 
	"Little warm this morning." Said the man. "Let me get the healer." 
	Hap closed his eyes, resting for a moment. Opening them, he found the tent darker and outside he heard the sound of men eating. "I must have taken a nap." He croaked, his voice thick with phlegm.
	"You certainly did." Said a woman who hustled across the to look at him. Her hand pressed on his forehead, cool and slightly damp. "Oh, you are warm." She said. "Well let's see about that. Think you're up to drinking a little?"
	Hap nodded quickly, thirstily. 
	She opened a bottle from his bedside table. "You'll need a little help, dear." She said. Holding his head up off of the pillow, she set the bottle to his lips, and poured a bit of medicine. 
	Haps mouth puckered at the bitterness, smelling like wood and turpentine. She waited for him to swallow. "I know it tastes awful, but that's medicine for you."
	She tipped a little more into his mouth. Hap closed his eyes and swallowed, trying to get past the foul taste and smell. 
	"Now for some water." She said. She held a spout to his mouth, and cool clean water washed the taste of medicine down his throat. He was thirsty, feeling dehydrated and the water tasted so good.
	"Enough for now." She said, pulling away the blessed water. "Don't want to get a cramp. I'll be back in a little bit to give you more." She patted his arm. "Don't worry, you getting the best help possible."
	Hap closed his eyes, feeling water bringing him strength. 

	"Hap?" 
	"Hap? Wake up." 
	Hap cracked his eyes. The felt scratchy, and hid body ached.
	DeMing stood beside his bed, his face showed contempt. "You don't look good." 
	Hap blinked his eyes, trying to understand why DeMing was standing there. Behind him, his four familiars stood, tall and pretty. Each one a cool, disdainful beauty.
	"Look at me." DeMing said. "Hey, how are you feeling?"
	Hap tried to reply, his voice a croak.
	"Yes, you don't look even that good." DeMing raised a hand, summoning the nurse. "Church yard. May be our only hope."
	She nodded, her mouth set in a grim line. "Right away, Lord."
	DeMing spun away, walking quickly. He wrinkled his nose, offended by the smell of the healer's tent. His four familiars glided after him, hips waving in a sensous parade.
	"We're going to put you in the church yard, dear." Said the nurse. "That will draw out the infection. I'm afraid the leshky had dirty claws and all of your wounds have infected."
	"What?" Hap croaked. "What are my chances." 
	"This is the best way." She said. She avoided answering, which meant she didn't want to lie. 
	Hap sank back, tired and aching. 

	I was loaded onto a stretcher from my bed and then moved onto a wagon. The ride was bumpy and took a while. I dozed, exhausted. I woke up to being unloaded from the wagon and carried through a church yard, around to the back. I was stripped naked including my bandages. My wounds stook out from my arm, red angry cuts that weeped blood and pus. They eased me into a shallow trench in the ground. My head was propped up and soil was shoveled over me. I felt cool, soil   soaking away some fever heat. 
	Sadly, I contemplated my grave. Buried six inches deep, with only my head above ground, I was as good a dead. The crunch of footsteps approached and I opened my eyes.
	An older man approached, he held some sort of watering can with a slim spout. 
	"Welcome to our church yard." He said. 
	I stared up at him, feeling the grotesque humor at his cheerful manner.
	"I know this is difficult." He said. "But we have a strong yard here, and many have emerged from the ground fit and healthy. You are in the best care possible for your injuries. Would you like a drink?" He offered the spout to me.
	I opened my mouth and he dribbled water in. Clean and cool, I sucked down as much as he would give.
	"Now, a few things. First, pee and poop as you feel fit. The soil cleans away such thing." He smiled, nodding. "Your wounds will be cleaned in the same way. I will be pulling back the dirt in a day or so to see how your are responding."
