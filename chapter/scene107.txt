	"How would you know if you were demon possessed?" DeMing said. 
	Hap gritted his teeth, frustrated. "I don't know. Sudden craving for blood? Willing to torture innocents for no reason?"
	"But would you notice that you were doing it?" DeMing said. "Would you realize that say, enslaving a town of people was evil, or just doing your job?"
	"I think so." Hap said.
	"I don't." DeMing said. "I don't believe you would if you were deluded. If a demon was riding in your brain and shaping your thoughts and feelings."
	"So, if you suddenly and randomly decided to seal a man, for no reason then you might be demon possessed?" Hap said.
	"Hmm." DeMing paused. "I see what you did there. But I know that I'm not deluded. I have an imp, a second opinion that rides around in my mind all the time. I ask him if I am possessed and he tells me the truth, that I am not."
	"Can you have more than one mind in your brain?" Hap said. "Is that possible? Or are you deluded?"
	"For my people, having one extra mind is possible and even necessary. We get to see our decisions from a second view." DeMing said. "Not only do we have an objective way of looking at our actions, but we have a way to expand our abilities."
	"What?" 
	"Among other things, we have a constant watcher looking for signs of demonic influence." DeMing said. He looked at Hap. "I can't be taken over by a demon."
	"Great. Give me one." Hap said.
	DeMing looked at Hap, thoughtfully. He seemed to be considering it carefully. "I don't think that would be a good idea." 
	"Why not?" Hap said. "Then you would know that I am demon free and everyone would be happy. Right?"
	 "If you have any demonic influence, the imp would begin destroying your brain in order to eliminate the demonic contamination." DeMing said. "That would be bad for you. Besides the imp is crafted especially for our brains. Even if you are completely free of possession, the imp could damage yours."
