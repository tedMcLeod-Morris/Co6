## overall plotting 
Hap threatens plans to replace the queen with the Baron Bird hunter daughter
HAP has saved the queen once, with magic and would conflict with the plot to  get rid of her. 
## MOTIVATION 
The kingdom is dying with crops failures causing famine and economic crisis for royalty. 
The queen is associated with fertility of the land. Her death and replacement will magically renew the land and end the crisis. 
The Baron believes that his daughter is the key to this problem as well as alignment of his family with the king's family. 
## OPPORTUNITY 
One of the Queens Guard has been corrupted. Even as the Queen hides in the Guard, the Baron is sending troops to kill them all. They will die on the edge of the frontier with monsters. 
The Baron means to bleed her dry in a field  as a sacrifice to end the famine.
