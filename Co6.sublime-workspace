She might be a forgotten allie\n  Hap fighting at the bridge - Piggly Wiggly training should be useless. Hap learned how to fight from either Renard or Eric. They know how to fight. I believe that fighting the way Piggly Wiggly trains is for cannon fodder and front line infantry intended to be quickly trained and cheaply expended in war. \n  Hap needs a friend to teach him two hand sword fighting and give hime a weapon that his strength will use effectively. \n  \n\nTODO: \n  ☐ Climax scene @due(+w)  \n  ☐ Mirror moment @due(19)\n  ☐ Writing schedule @due(24)\n\n\n",
